# Load Cell (Part 1)
Weigh anything using your Arduino

# See video #31 at https://www.youtube.com/RalphBacon

Want to weigh something with uncanny precision? Use a Load Cell and an HX711 detector and you're in business! A what cell? All will be explained. And it is so very easy you will be amazed.

The sketch can be found here in this repository.

The library can be found here: https://github.com/bogde/HX711

Calibration and seed-setting sketches can be found in this repository.
 
And if you use an Arduino Micro or Sparkfun Pro Micro what do you have to guard against if you don't want a 'bricked' Arduino? Watch to find out. Yes, it happened to me, don't let it happen to you.

And what has the postman delivered lately? A stepper motor, an Arduino Mega, an RFID ... well, watch and find out.

And for the completion of the LOAD CELL project don't miss the next video part 2 which will concentrate on the way I've mounted the hardware, the software with some simple demo code - easy. That's all coming in Part 2 (video #32).
